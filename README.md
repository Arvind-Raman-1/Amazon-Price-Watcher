# Amazon Web Scraper

This is a file that scrapes the price from a certain product that you would like to buy and runs this daily. When the price dips below a certain value that yo can set, it will send out an email with the link to buy the product, so you are informed of any sale. 
Project was built using python package beautifulsoup 


future edits: The project had good results till I ran into Amazon's reCAPTCHA. Will need to try to find a way to bypass this
